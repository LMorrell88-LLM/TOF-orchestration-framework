# TOF Orchestration Framework

Transparency Framework for AI Hallucination Detection
Bridge Summaries â€¢ Admin Notes â€¢ Sentinel Flags

## Overview

The **TOF Orchestration Framework** proposes a modular transparency layer for large language models (LLMs), designed to improve reliability and reduce hallucinations.
TOF focuses on three core mechanisms:

**Bridge Summaries** â€” carry forward rolling summaries across context windows (Context Utilization Trigger >85%).
**Admin Notes** â€” capture, store, and reinject validated information into the model.
**Sentinel Flags** â€” detect and visually flag uncertainty in generated outputs.

This repository hosts the diagrams, architecture notes, and supporting research for TOF.

## Research Impact

AI systems are evolving faster than our ability to **trust** them.
Large language models are powerful, but they suffer from **hallucinations** â€” confidently generating information that may be incorrect, unverifiable, or fabricated.

The **TOF Orchestration Framework** explores a path forward by introducing mechanisms to make model reasoning transparent, traceable, and verifiable:

**Continuity Loss** â†’ solved with **Bridge Summaries** carrying rolling context across resets.
**Fact Drift** â†’ solved with **Admin Notes** capturing and reinjecting verified facts.
**Invisible Uncertainty** â†’ solved with **Sentinel Flags** detecting and highlighting when the model is guessing.

TOF is **framework-agnostic** and can be applied to OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source LLMs, or future architectures.

By making uncertainty **visible**, facts **portable**, and context **persistent**, TOF supports:

Research into **hallucination detection** and model verification.
Transparent decision-making in AI-powered systems.
Policy discussions on **responsible deployment of generative AI.**

This repository makes TOF openly available for **research, reference, and citation.**
